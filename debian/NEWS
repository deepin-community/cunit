cunit (2.1-3-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with the cunit package version 2.1-2.dfsg-3, the libraries are
  shipped in the multiarch directory /lib/<triplet> instead of the more
  traditional /lib, where <triplet> is the multiarch triplet and can be
  retrieved with 'dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH'.
  
  The toolchain in Debian has been updated to cope with that, and most
  build systems should be unaffected. If you are using a non-Debian
  toolchain to build your software and it is not able to cope with
  multiarch, you might try to pass the following options to your
  compiler:
  
    -B/usr/lib/<triplet>
  
  Alternatively if the build system makes hard to pass the above options,
  you might try to set the LIBRARY_PATH and CPATH environment variables:
    LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/<triplet>
    export LIBRARY_PATH
